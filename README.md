# Python_Showcase

Hi This is my very own Python Showcase built for showcasing my Python Programs created so far

I have added a few samples here that showcase the following:
a) Data Exploration, Pre Processing, Raw Data Handling
b) Data Visualization
c) Data Modeling Techniques like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and KNN
d) Programs make use of the most popular libraries and functions from Python, namely numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit learn and matplotlib, seaborn
